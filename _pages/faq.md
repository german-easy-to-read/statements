# Frequently asked questions

## What tools are allowed to solve the task?
  All technological solutions are welcome. To foster scientific reproducibility, we encourage you to use open-source software and data solutions whenever possible. Nevertheless, we don't prohibit using any tool, software, or model.

## Why do you split sentences like `Eine Angel ist eine Schnur mit einem Haken` into two statements?
  Our statements focus mostly on chunks of information that need to be understood by the readers. From a content perspective, a fishing rod always consists of a string and a hook, so splitting these into two statements makes no sense. However, the reader still has to parse two separate statements independently: 1) there is a string, and 2) there is a hook. Therefore, we decided to split the sentence into two statements.

## How did you annotate your data?
