# Paper Submission 
We welcome all technological solutions. To foster scientific reproducibility we encourage you to use open source and data solutions whenever possible.  

All paper submissions must be formatted according to [KONVENS 2024 guidelines](https://konvens-2024.univie.ac.at/calls/call-for-papers). We accept three kinds of submissions:

- Long papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content. 
- Short papers and demonstration papers must not exceed four (4) pages of content.
- Non-archival abstracts must not exceed one (1) page. 

References do not count against these limits. Supplementary material does not count towards the page limit and should be included in the appendix.

Please submit your papers directly to the organizer's email at [statements@soc.cit.tum.de](mailto:statements@soc.cit.tum.de).

## Submission Form
We strongly encourage authors to use LaTeX to prepare their documents. 


## Reviewing
Reviewing of papers will be single-blind. 

## Dual Submission Policy
Dual submissions of papers are allowed and welcome.

# Predictions Submission
We use [Codabench](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/3244) to score your submissions. Please upload your predictions for the test data, and also later for the eval data there. For the development phase, you have a unlimited number of uploads. For the final phase, you can only upload three submissions per day, please keep that in mind during the 2nd phase.

Please notice, that we have included sentences with 0 statements in the trial, train and test data. This means that those sentences are incomplete or erroneous. In this case, even sentences with multiple statements can be annotated by 0. Nonetheless, we left them in the data to create a real world experiences.

**Please be aware, that our scoring does not consider 0-statements and 0-statements can cause errors in the evaluation. Furthermore, none of the sentences in eval dataset has 0 statements.**
